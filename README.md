# credit-risk

Developed an end-to-end credit risk prediction system using logistic regression to evaluate loan default probabilities.

Designed a responsive Streamlit-based user interface for loan applicants to input financial and personal information interactively.

Engineered relevant features including loan-to-income ratio, credit utilization, and delinquency metrics to improve model interpretability.

Used scikit-learn for model development and MinMaxScaler for consistent preprocessing across deployment and training.

Translated model output into credit scores (300â€“900) and assigned credit ratings (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent) dynamically.

Enabled real-time predictions with probability output and intuitive credit rating feedback for both customers and loan officers.
